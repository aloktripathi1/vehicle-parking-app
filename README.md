# Vehicle Parking App

A multi-user 4-wheeler parking management system built with Flask and SQLite.  
This project is part of **Modern Application Development I** at IITM BS.

## 👥 Roles

- **Admin**: Superuser who can manage parking lots, view all spots/users, and access full parking history. Admin is automatically created on first run—no registration required.
  - Default credentials: `admin@parkease.com` / `admin123`
  - Credentials can be customized via environment variables (see Configuration below)
- **User**: Can register/login, reserve, park, and release spots.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Flask (Python)
- SQLite (Programmatic DB setup via SQLAlchemy)
- Jinja2 (Templating)
- Bootstrap 5.3 (CSS Framework)
- Bootstrap Icons (Icons)
- HTML/CSS (Frontend - simplified, minimal custom styling)

## 🏁 How to Run

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the app
python app.py
```

The database and default admin user will be created automatically on first run.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Admin Credentials
The default admin is automatically created when the app runs for the first time. You can customize the admin credentials using environment variables:

```bash
# Set custom admin credentials (optional)
export ADMIN_EMAIL="youradmin@example.com"
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
export ADMIN_NAME="Your Admin Name"

# Then run the app
python app.py
```

**Default Admin Credentials** (if environment variables are not set):
- Email: `admin@parkease.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Name: `Admin User`

**Note**: Admin registration is not allowed. The admin user is created programmatically only.
